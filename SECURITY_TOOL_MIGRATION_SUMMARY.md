# Crackerjack Security Tool Migration: Detect-Secrets to Gitleaks

## Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the migration from `detect-secrets` to `gitleaks` for secret detection in the Crackerjack project. This migration ensures we're using modern, actively maintained security tools with better performance and detection capabilities.

## Migration Details

### Files Updated

1. **`crackerjack/executors/cached_hook_executor.py`**

   - Modified the `should_use_cache_for_hook` method to reference `gitleaks` instead of `detect-secrets` in the external hooks set
   - Changed: `external_hooks = {"detect-secrets"}` → `external_hooks = {"gitleaks"}`

1. **`crackerjack/orchestration/execution_strategies.py`**

   - Updated priority hook selection logic to use `gitleaks` instead of `detect-secrets`
   - Changed: `priority_hooks.update(["bandit", "creosote", "detect-secrets"])` → `priority_hooks.update(["bandit", "creosote", "gitleaks"])`

1. **`docs/systems/CACHING_SYSTEM.md`**

   - Removed outdated `detect-secrets` entry from the caching TTL table
   - Ensured only `gitleaks` is listed for secret detection

### Verification Completed

- ✅ All source code references to `detect-secrets` have been removed
- ✅ All references to `gitleaks` are consistent throughout the codebase
- ✅ Configuration files properly reference `gitleaks`
- ✅ Documentation has been updated to reflect the change
- ✅ Pre-commit configuration already properly configured with `gitleaks`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Active Maintenance**: Gitleaks is actively maintained with regular updates
1. **Better Performance**: Gitleaks offers superior performance compared to detect-secrets
1. **Enhanced Detection**: Gitleaks has a more comprehensive ruleset for secret detection
1. **Community Support**: Larger community and better documentation
1. **Integration**: Better integration with modern development workflows

## Technical Details

Gitleaks is now properly integrated throughout the Crackerjack ecosystem:

- **Caching Strategy**: Configured with a 7-day TTL for optimal performance
- **Execution Strategies**: Properly prioritized in hook execution workflows
- **External Hook Handling**: Correctly identified as an external hook that shouldn't use caching
- **Documentation**: Fully documented in system architecture documents

This migration ensures that our secret detection capabilities remain strong while using the best available tooling in the ecosystem, maintaining Crackerjack's commitment to cutting-edge security practices.
