python -m crackerjack --comprehensive

# Use comprehensive mode for releases
python -m crackerjack --comprehensive -a patch
```

### üì¶ Pre-push Hooks (CI/CD Integration)

For expensive operations that should run before pushing to remote repositories:

```bash
# Install pre-push hooks for comprehensive checks
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push

# Manual pre-push validation
python -m crackerjack --comprehensive --test
```

### Performance Comparison

| Mode | Execution Time | Use Case | Hooks Count |
|------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| **Fast** | \<5s | Regular development | 8 essential hooks |
| **Comprehensive** | \<30s | Pre-release, important commits | 15+ thorough hooks |
| **Pre-push** | Variable | CI/CD, remote push | All hooks + extended analysis |

### Hook Categories

**Fast Mode Hooks:**

1. **uv-lock:** Ensures the `uv.lock` file is up to date
1. **Core pre-commit-hooks:** Essential hooks (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer)
1. **Ruff:** Fast linting and formatting
1. **Detect-secrets:** Security credential detection
1. **Codespell:** Spelling mistake correction
1. **mdformat:** Markdown formatting

**Additional Comprehensive Mode Hooks:**
7\. **Vulture:** Dead code detection

9\. **Complexipy:** Code complexity analysis
10\. **Autotyping:** Automatic type hint generation
11\. **Refurb:** Code modernization suggestions
12\. **Bandit:** Security vulnerability scanning
13\. **Pyright:** Static type checking
14\. **Extended Ruff:** Additional formatting passes

### Smart Hook Selection

Crackerjack automatically selects the appropriate hook configuration based on:

- **Operation Type**: Fast for regular development, comprehensive for releases
- **User Preference**: Explicit `--fast` or `--comprehensive` flags
- **CI/CD Context**: Pre-push hooks for remote operations
- **Project Size**: Larger projects may benefit from fast mode during development

## The Crackerjack Style Guide

Crackerjack projects adhere to these guidelines:

- **Static Typing:** Use type hints consistently throughout your code.
- **Modern Type Hints:** Use the pipe operator (`|`) for union types (e.g., `Path | None` instead of `Optional[Path]`).
- **Explicit Naming:** Choose clear, descriptive names for classes, functions, variables, and other identifiers.
- **Markdown for Documentation:** Use Markdown (`.md`) for all documentation, READMEs, etc.
- **Pathlib:** Use `pathlib.Path` for handling file and directory paths instead of `os.path`.
- **Consistent Imports:** Use `import typing as t` for type hinting and prefix all typing references with `t.`.
- **Protocol-Based Design:** Use `t.Protocol` for interface definitions instead of abstract base classes.
- **Constants and Config:** Do not use all-caps for constants or configuration settings.
- **Path Parameters:** Functions that handle file operations should accept `pathlib.Path` objects as parameters.
- **Dependency Management:** Use UV for dependency management, package building, and publishing.
- **Testing:** Use pytest as your testing framework.
- **Python Version:** Crackerjack projects target Python 3.13+ and use the latest language features.
- **Clear Code:** Avoid overly complex code.
- **Modular:** Functions should do one thing well.

## Testing Features

Crackerjack provides advanced testing capabilities powered by pytest:

### Standard Testing

- **Parallel Test Execution:** Tests run in parallel by default using pytest-xdist for faster execution
- **Smart Parallelization:** Automatically adjusts the number of worker processes based on project size
- **Timeout Protection:** Tests have dynamic timeouts based on project size to prevent hanging tests
- **Coverage Reports:** Automatically generates test coverage reports with configurable thresholds

### Advanced Test Configuration

Crackerjack offers fine-grained control over test execution:

- **Worker Control:** Set the number of parallel workers with `--test-workers` (0 = auto-detect, 1 = disable parallelization)
- **Timeout Control:** Customize test timeouts with `--test-timeout` (in seconds)
- **Project Size Detection:** Automatically detects project size and adjusts timeout and parallelization settings
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Uses advanced threading techniques to prevent deadlocks in test output processing
- **Progress Tracking:** Shows periodic heartbeat messages for long-running tests

Example test execution options:

```bash
# Run tests with a single worker (no parallelization)
python -m crackerjack -t --test-workers=1

# Run tests with a specific number of workers (e.g., 4)
python -m crackerjack -t --test-workers=4

# Run tests with a custom timeout (5 minutes per test)
python -m crackerjack -t --test-timeout=300

# Combine options for maximum control
python -m crackerjack -t --test-workers=2 --test-timeout=600
```

### Benchmark Testing & Performance Monitoring

Crackerjack includes comprehensive benchmark testing capabilities designed for continuous performance monitoring and regression detection:

#### üìä Core Benchmark Features

- **Performance Measurement:** Accurately measure execution time, memory usage, and function calls
- **Regression Detection:** Automatic detection of performance degradation between code changes
- **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical validation of performance differences with confidence intervals
- **Historical Tracking:** Track performance trends across commits and releases
- **CI/CD Integration:** Seamless integration with continuous integration pipelines
- **AI Agent Output:** JSON format benchmark results for automated analysis

#### üöÄ Benchmark Execution Modes

**Basic Benchmarking:**

```bash
# Run tests with performance measurement
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark

# Combine with AI agent mode for structured output
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark --ai-agent
```

**Regression Testing:**

```bash
# Run benchmarks with regression detection (5% threshold)
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark-regression

# Custom regression threshold (fail if >10% slower)
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark-regression --benchmark-regression-threshold=10.0

# Strict regression testing for critical performance paths (2% threshold)
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark-regression --benchmark-regression-threshold=2.0
```

#### üìà Strategic Benchmark Scheduling

**üöÄ Critical Scenarios (Always Run Benchmarks):**

- Before major releases
- After significant algorithmic changes
- When performance-critical code is modified

**üìä Regular Monitoring (Weekly):**

- Automated CI/CD pipeline execution
- Performance drift detection
- Long-term trend analysis

**üé≤ Random Sampling (10% of commits):**

- Stochastic performance monitoring
- Gradual performance regression detection
- Statistical baseline maintenance

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation

When benchmarks are executed, Crackerjack:

1. **Disables Parallel Execution**: Ensures accurate timing measurements (pytest-benchmark incompatible with pytest-xdist)
1. **Optimizes Configuration**: Configures pytest-benchmark with performance-optimized settings
1. **Baseline Comparison**: Compares results against previous runs for regression detection
1. **Statistical Validation**: Uses statistical methods to determine significant performance changes
1. **JSON Export**: Generates machine-readable results for automated analysis (with `--ai-agent`)

#### üéØ Benchmark Best Practices

**Threshold Guidelines:**

- **2-5% threshold**: For release candidates and critical performance paths
- **5-10% threshold**: For regular development and monitoring
- **10%+ threshold**: For experimental features and early development

**Execution Strategy:**

```bash
# Development workflow with benchmarks
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark --test-workers=1

# Release validation with strict thresholds
python -m crackerjack -t --benchmark-regression --benchmark-regression-threshold=2.0

# CI/CD integration with structured output
python -m crackerjack --ai-agent -t --benchmark-regression --benchmark-regression-threshold=5.0
```

#### üìÅ Benchmark Output Files

When using `--ai-agent` mode, benchmark results are exported to:

- **`benchmark.json`**: Detailed performance metrics and statistical analysis
- **`test-results.xml`**: JUnit XML format with benchmark integration
- **`ai-agent-summary.json`**: Summary including benchmark status and regression analysis

This comprehensive approach ensures that performance regressions are caught early while maintaining development velocity.

## Intelligent Commit Messages

Crackerjack includes a smart commit message generation system that analyzes your git changes and suggests descriptive commit messages based on the files modified and the type of changes made.

### How It Works

When you use the `-c` (commit) flag, Crackerjack automatically:

1. **Analyzes Changes**: Scans `git diff` to understand what files were added, modified, deleted, or renamed
1. **Categorizes Files**: Groups changes by type (documentation, tests, core functionality, configuration, dependencies)
1. **Suggests Message**: Generates a descriptive commit message with appropriate action verbs and categorization
1. **Interactive Choice**: Offers options to use the suggestion, edit it, or write a custom message

### Message Format

Generated commit messages follow this structure:

```
[Action] [primary changes] and [secondary changes]

- Added N file(s)
  * path/to/new/file.py
  * path/to/another/file.py

  ```

#### Version Management & PyPI Publishing

Crackerjack provides comprehensive PyPI publishing with enhanced authentication and validation.

**üîê PyPI Authentication Setup**

Crackerjack automatically validates your authentication setup before publishing and provides helpful error messages. Choose one of these authentication methods:

**Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**

```bash
# Set PyPI token as environment variable
export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN=pypi-your-token-here

# Publish with automatic token authentication
python -m crackerjack -p patch
```

**Method 2: Keyring Integration**

```bash
# Install keyring globally or in current environment
uv tool install keyring

# Store PyPI token in keyring (you'll be prompted for the token)
keyring set https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__

# Ensure keyring provider is configured in pyproject.toml
[tool.uv]
keyring-provider = "subprocess"

# Publish with keyring authentication
python -m crackerjack -p patch
```

**Method 3: Environment Variable for Keyring Provider**

```bash
# Set keyring provider via environment
export UV_KEYRING_PROVIDER=subprocess

# Publish (will use keyring for authentication)
python -m crackerjack -p patch
```

**Authentication Validation**

Crackerjack automatically validates your authentication setup before publishing:

- ‚úÖ **Token Found**: When `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` is set
- ‚úÖ **Keyring Ready**: When keyring is configured and token is stored
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Setup Needed**: When authentication needs configuration

If publishing fails due to authentication issues, crackerjack displays helpful setup instructions.

**PyPI Token Best Practices**

1. **Generate Project-Specific Tokens**: Create separate PyPI tokens for each project
1. **Use Scoped Tokens**: Limit token scope to the specific package you're publishing
1. **Secure Storage**: Use environment variables or keyring - never hardcode tokens
1. **Token Format**: PyPI tokens start with `pypi-` (e.g., `pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJGZm...`)

**Troubleshooting Authentication**

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. **Check Token Format**: Ensure your token starts with `pypi-`
1. **Verify Environment Variable**: `echo $UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` should show your token
1. **Test Keyring**: `keyring get https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ __token__` should return your token
1. **Check Configuration**: Ensure `keyring-provider = "subprocess"` in pyproject.toml
1. **Install Keyring**: `uv tool install keyring` if using keyring authentication

**Version Management Commands**

- **Bump and Publish** - Bump version and publish to PyPI:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -p patch  # For patch version
  python -m crackerjack -p minor  # For minor version
  python -m crackerjack -p major  # For major version
  ```

- **Version Bump Only** - Bump version without publishing:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -b major
  ```

#### Documentation Template Management

Crackerjack can automatically propagate its quality standards to other Python projects by creating or updating their CLAUDE.md and RULES.md files. This ensures consistent AI code generation across all projects.

**üìÑ Template Propagation Commands**

```bash
# Update CLAUDE.md and RULES.md with latest quality standards (only if they don't exist)
python -m crackerjack --update-docs

# Force update CLAUDE.md and RULES.md even if they already exist
python -m crackerjack --force-update-docs
```

**When to Use Documentation Templates**

- **New Projects**: Use `--update-docs` to create initial documentation templates
- **Quality Standard Updates**: Use `--force-update-docs` weekly to keep standards current
- **AI Integration**: Ensures Claude Code generates compliant code on first pass across all projects
- **Team Synchronization**: Keeps all team projects using the same quality standards

**How Template Management Works**

- **Quality Standards**: Copies the latest Refurb, Pyright, Complexipy, and Bandit standards from Crackerjack
- **Project Customization**: Customizes project-specific sections (project name, overview)
- **Standard Preservation**: Preserves the core quality standards and AI generation guidelines
- **Git Integration**: Automatically adds files to git for easy committing

This feature is particularly valuable for teams maintaining multiple Python projects, ensuring that AI assistants generate consistent, high-quality code across all repositories.

#### Configuration Management

- **Skip Config Updates** - Run checks without updating configuration files:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -n
  ```

- **Update Hooks** - Update pre-commit hooks to latest versions:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -u
  ```

#### Git Operations

- **Commit Changes** - Run checks and commit changes:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -c
  ```

- **Create PR** - Create a pull request to the upstream repository:

  ```bash
  python -m crackerjack -r
  ```
