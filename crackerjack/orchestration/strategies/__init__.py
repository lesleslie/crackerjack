"""Execution strategies for hook orchestration.

This package provides different execution strategies for running hooks:
- ParallelExecutionStrategy: Concurrent execution with resource limits
- SequentialExecutionStrategy: One-at-a-time execution for dependent hooks

Strategies implement ExecutionStrategyProtocol and handle:
- Timeout management per hook
- Exception isolation
- Resource limiting (semaphores for parallel)
- Early exit on critical failures (sequential)
