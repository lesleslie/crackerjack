"""Rust tool adapters for unified integration.

QA Framework Adapters:
The QA framework adapters are organized by check type in subdirectories:
- format/: Code formatting (ruff, mdformat)
- lint/: Code linting (codespell)
- security/: Security scanning (bandit, gitleaks)
- type/: Type checking (zuban)
- refactor/: Refactoring suggestions (refurb, creosote)
- complexity/: Complexity analysis (complexipy)
- utility/: Utility checks (text patterns, EOF, syntax, size, deps)
- shared/: Base classes for all QA adapters

ACB 0.19.0+ auto-discovers adapters via depends.set() at module level.
