"""Final strategic test file - removed problematic client_runner test due to import error.

Note: client_runner.py has import dependency issues that prevent basic import testing.
The import error occurs because client_runner tries to import 'run_crackerjack_with_enhanced_progress'
which is not available in the progress_monitor module.
