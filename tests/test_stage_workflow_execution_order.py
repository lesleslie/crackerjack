"""
Tests to verify workflow stage execution order under different options.

Tests cover the critical workflow ordering requirements:
1. Fast hooks run first
2. Code cleaning runs after fast hooks when -x is set
3. Post-cleaning fast hooks run after cleaning for sanity check
4. Tests and comprehensive hooks run after cleaning (when both -x and -t are set)
5. AI agents trigger cleaning if not already done
