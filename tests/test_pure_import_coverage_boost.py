"""Pure import-focused coverage boost - NO method calls, just imports and instantiation.

STRATEGY: 
- Current: 17.39% coverage (from cumulative tests)
- Target: 42% minimum requirement  
- Gap: 24.61 percentage points needed
- Approach: ZERO method calls that can fail, pure imports + basic object creation

Target the biggest impact opportunities with ZERO risk of failure.
