### Integration Strategy
```python
# Example: Building on existing cache system
class EnhancedCacheHandlers(CacheHandlers):
    """Extends existing cache handlers with advanced features."""
    
    def __init__(self, cache: CrackerjackCache | None = None):
        self.cache = cache or CrackerjackCache()  # Use existing cache
        
    def handle_cache_optimize(self, console: Console) -> None:
        """New optimization features built on existing foundation."""
        # Leverage existing cache infrastructure
        stats = self.cache.get_cache_stats()  # Use existing method
        # Add new optimization logic
```
