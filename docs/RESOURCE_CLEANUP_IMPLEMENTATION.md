## üîß Usage Patterns

### Basic Resource Management

```python
from crackerjack.core.resource_manager import ResourceContext


async def my_function():
    async with ResourceContext() as ctx:
        # Create managed temporary file
        temp_file = ctx.managed_temp_file(suffix=".txt")
        await temp_file.initialize()

        # Create managed process
        process = subprocess.Popen([...])
        managed_proc = ctx.managed_process(process)
        await managed_proc.start_monitoring()

        # Resources are automatically cleaned up
```

### WebSocket Server Management

```python
from crackerjack.core.websocket_lifecycle import with_websocket_server


async def websocket_handler(websocket):
    # Handle WebSocket connection
    pass


async with with_websocket_server(8675, websocket_handler) as server:
    # Server runs with automatic cleanup
    await server.start()
```

### Atomic File Operations

```python
from crackerjack.core.file_lifecycle import atomic_file_write

async with atomic_file_write(path, backup=True) as writer:
    writer.write("New content")
    # Automatically commits or rolls back on error
```

### Network Resource Management

```python
from crackerjack.core.websocket_lifecycle import NetworkResourceManager

async with NetworkResourceManager() as manager:
    # Create managed HTTP client
    client = await manager.create_http_client()

    # Create managed subprocess
    process = subprocess.Popen([...])
    managed_proc = manager.create_subprocess(process)

    # All resources cleaned up automatically
```
