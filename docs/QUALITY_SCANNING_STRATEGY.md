# Crackerjack Quality Scanning: Strategic Decision Framework

## Executive Summary

We need to optimize slow quality hooks (refurb, complexipy, skylos) that take 10+ minutes per scan. Three complementary approaches are available:

1. **Incremental Scanning**: Scan only changed files (10-20x faster)
1. **Mahavishnu Pools**: Parallel tool execution (2.5-3x faster)
1. **Combined Approach**: Incremental + Pools (30-60x faster for typical commits)

**Recommendation**: Implement **Combined Approach** in phases for maximum impact with manageable risk.

______________________________________________________________________

## Current State Analysis

### Tool Performance (Full Repository Scan)

| Tool | Time | Purpose | Alternative |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| **refurb** | 290s | Python modernization suggestions | None (keep!) |
| **complexipy** | 605s | Cognitive complexity analysis | ruff complexity (10-20x faster) |
| **skylos** | 60s | Dead code detection (Rust) | vulture (Python, 2-5x slower) |
| **semgrep** | 70s | Security vulnerability patterns | None (security critical) |
| **gitleaks** | 29s | Secret detection | None (security critical) |

**Total Slow Tools**: ~1054 seconds (17.5 minutes)

### Tool Classification by Usage Pattern

**Frequently Run (Daily Workflows)**:

- Should be FAST: \<60 seconds
- Tools: ruff, vulture, codespell, check-jsonschema
- Current: ✅ Already fast

**Moderately Frequent (Pre-commit, CI)**:

- Should be MODERATE: 1-3 minutes
- Tools: refurb, skylos, semgrep
- Current: ❌ 290s, 60s, 70s (too slow)

**Less Frequent (Publish, Release)**:

- Can be SLOW: 5-10 minutes acceptable
- Tools: complexipy, full security scans
- Current: ⚠️ 605s (too slow even for publish)

______________________________________________________________________

## Decision Matrix

### Option 1: Tool Substitution (Quick Win)

**Approach**: Replace slow tools with faster alternatives for daily workflows.

| Tool | Current | Alternative | Speedup | Trade-off |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| complexipy | 605s | ruff complexity | 10-20x | Fewer complexity metrics |
| skylos | 60s | vulture | 0.5x (slower) | Python vs Rust, different detection |

**Implementation**:

```yaml
# .crackerjack.yaml
tools:
  complexity:
    daily: ruff      # Fast, good enough for daily
    publish: complexipy  # Comprehensive for releases

  dead_code:
    daily: vulture    # Slower but good enough
    publish: skylos   # Fastest, most comprehensive
```

**Pros**:

- ✅ Easy to implement (1 hour)
- ✅ No architectural changes
- ✅ Immediate speedup (10-20x for complexity)

**Cons**:

- ❌ Loses some tool capabilities
- ❌ Two sets of tool outputs to maintain
- ❌ Doesn't solve root problem (full scans)

**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: 5-10x speedup for workflows that use complexipy
**Risk**: Low

______________________________________________________________________

### Option 2: Incremental Scanning (High Impact)

**Approach**: Scan only files changed since last successful run.

**Three Implementation Variants**:

#### 2A: Git-Diff-Based (Simplest)

```python
# Scan files changed since HEAD~1
files = git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD
refurb [files]
```

**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Speedup**: 10-20x for small commits
**Risk**: Low

#### 2B: Marker-Based (Most Accurate)

```python
# Track per-file scan timestamps
if file.hash != last_scanned_hash:
    scan(file)
```

**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Speedup**: 15-30x (handles edge cases better)
**Risk**: Medium (database management)

#### 2C: Hybrid (Recommended)

```python
# Use git-diff with periodic full scans
if days_since_last_full_scan > 7:
    full_scan()
else:
    incremental_scan()
```

**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Speedup**: 10-20x (with safety net)
**Risk**: Low

**Pros**:

- ✅ Dramatic speedup for typical commits
- ✅ Works with all tools
- ✅ Minimal behavior change

**Cons**:

- ❌ Can miss issues in refactored code
- ❌ Requires periodic full scans
- ❌ Adds complexity to hook system

______________________________________________________________________

### Option 3: Mahavishnu Pools (Scalability)

**Approach**: Distribute tool execution across worker pools for parallel processing.

**Architecture**:

```
Crackerjack → Mahavishnu Pool Manager → 8 Parallel Workers
    ↓                                          ↓
  File List                                  refurb (files 1-10)
    ↓                                          ↓
  Task Distributor                           complexipy (files 11-20)
    ↓                                          ↓
  Result Aggregator                         skylos (files 21-30)
                                               ↓
                                            [5 more workers...]
```

**Effort**: 4-6 hours (Phase 1), +4 hours (optimization)
**Speedup**: 2.5-3x for full scans, 3-6x for incremental
**Risk**: Medium (mahavishnu dependency)

**Pros**:

- ✅ Scales to large codebases
- ✅ Works with all tools transparently
- ✅ Fault isolation (worker crashes don't affect others)
- ✅ Can use Kubernetes for massive parallelism

**Cons**:

- ❌ Mahavishnu must be running
- ❌ More complex architecture
- ❌ Debugging distributed execution harder
- ❌ Resource overhead (pool management)

______________________________________________________________________

### Option 4: Combined Approach (Maximum Impact) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Approach**: Use incremental scanning for file filtering + mahavishnu pools for parallel execution.

**Workflow**:

```
1. File Scanner (git-diff)
   └─> Get 20 changed files

2. Task Distributor
   └─> Split into 4 chunks (5 files each)

3. Mahavishnu Pool (8 workers)
   ├─> Worker 1: refurb chunk 1
   ├─> Worker 2: refurb chunk 2
   ├─> Worker 3: complexipy chunk 1
   ├─> Worker 4: complexipy chunk 2
   ├─> Worker 5: skylos chunk 1
   ├─> Worker 6: skylos chunk 2
   ├─> Worker 7: semgrep all files
   └─> Worker 8: gitleaks all files

4. Result Aggregator
   └─> Combine outputs, generate report
```

**Performance**:
| Commit Size | Old Time | New Time | Speedup |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Small (5-10 files) | 10+ min | 10-20s | **30-60x** |
| Medium (10-50 files) | 10+ min | 20-40s | **15-30x** |
| Large (50+ files) | 10+ min | 2-3 min | **3-5x** |
| Publish (full scan) | 10+ min | 3-4 min | **2.5-3x** |

**Implementation Phases**:

- **Phase 1** (2-3 hours): Git-diff incremental scanning
- **Phase 2** (2-3 hours): Mahavishnu pool integration
- **Phase 3** (1-2 hours): Combine incremental + pools
- **Phase 4** (2-3 hours): Optimization and monitoring

**Total Effort**: 7-11 hours
**Total Speedup**: 30-60x for typical commits
**Risk**: Medium (complex but phased)

______________________________________________________________________

## Tool-Specific Recommendations

### refurb (Python Modernization)

**Status**: ✅ Keep using! <!-- legacy status — see YAML frontmatter -->
**Reason**: Actively maintained, finds useful modernization opportunities for Python 3.13+
**Strategy**:

- Daily: Incremental scan (changed files only)
- Publish: Full scan with mahavishnu pools
  **Time Savings**: 290s → 10-30s (incremental), ~100s (pooled)

### complexipy (Cognitive Complexity)

**Status**: ⚠️ Too slow for daily use
**Reason**: 605 seconds is excessive even for publish
**Strategy**:

- Daily: Use ruff complexity instead (10-20x faster)
- Publish: Use complexipy with mahavishnu pools (3-4x faster than current)
  **Time Savings**: 605s → 5s (ruff), ~150s (pooled complexipy)

### skylos (Dead Code Detection)

**Status**: ✅ Excellent, but position wrong
**Reason**: Rust-based, fastest dead code detector available
**Strategy**:

- Daily: Use vulture (slower but good enough)
- Publish: Use skylos (fastest and most comprehensive)
  **Time Savings**: 60s → 30s (vulture), ~20s (pooled skylos)

______________________________________________________________________
