# Test Coverage Improvement Progress Report

## Current Status

We have made significant progress in improving the test coverage for the session-mgmt-mcp project:

1. **Initial Coverage**: ~11.7%
1. **Current Coverage**: ~14.1%
1. **Tests Passing**: 16/24 AdvancedSearch tests now pass (up from 1/18 previously)

## Completed Work

### Fixed Infrastructure Issues

- Fixed database initialization issues in tests
- Fixed import and fixture errors in failing tests
- Fixed SessionPermissionsManager constructor issues
- Updated SessionPermissionsManager tests to match current implementation
- Fixed missing method calls in ReflectionDatabase tests
- Fixed DuckDB syntax issues in ReflectionDatabase implementation

### Implemented New Unit Tests

- Created comprehensive tests for SessionLifecycleManager
- Started work on AdvancedSearch tests with 16/24 tests now passing
- Fixed database connection and initialization in test fixtures

### Improved Test Architecture

- Modified test fixtures to properly handle temporary database files
- Fixed JSON extraction issues in DuckDB queries
- Corrected filter condition building for DuckDB compatibility

## Remaining Work

### AdvancedSearch Tests (7 failing)

1. **test_search_by_content_type** - Need to implement content type filtering
1. **test_search_with_sorting** - Need to implement proper sorting functionality
1. **test_search_with_timeframe** - Need to implement timeframe-based filtering
1. **test_search_suggestions** - Need to implement search suggestions functionality
1. **test_search_by_timeframe** - Need to implement timeframe-based search
1. **test_error_handling_malformed_timeframe** - Need to improve error handling
1. **test_search_case_insensitive** - Need to implement case-insensitive search

### Core Module Unit Tests (Highest Priority)

1. **MultiProjectCoordinator** (~21.43% coverage)

   - Test project group creation and management
   - Test dependency tracking and visualization
   - Test cross-project search functionality
   - Test session linking between projects

1. **TokenOptimizer** (~13.20% coverage)

   - Test token counting accuracy
   - Test different optimization strategies
   - Test caching mechanisms
   - Test performance with large content

1. **ReflectionDatabase** (~17.70% coverage)

   - Test database operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Test search functionality with various query types
   - Test embedding generation and similarity matching
   - Test error handling and edge cases

### Integration Tests

1. **Session Lifecycle Integration**

   - Test complete workflow from init to end
   - Test MCP tool registration and execution
   - Test cross-module interactions

1. **Multi-Project Integration**

   - Test project group workflows
   - Test dependency management across projects
   - Test cross-project search scenarios

### Specialized Tests

1. **Property-Based Tests**

   - Use Hypothesis to test robustness with random inputs
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

1. **Performance Tests**

   - Test scalability and response times
   - Test memory usage with large datasets
   - Test concurrent access patterns

1. **Security Tests**

   - Test permission system and access controls
   - Test input validation and sanitization
   - Test protection against injection attacks

1. **Edge Case Tests**

   - Test error handling for malformed inputs
   - Test behavior with empty or null values
   - Test recovery from various failure modes

## Target Improvements

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 days)

- Fix remaining AdvancedSearch test failures
- Implement missing functionality for content type filtering, sorting, and timeframe filtering
- Reach 25%+ coverage

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)

- Implement unit tests for MultiProjectCoordinator and TokenOptimizer
- Add integration tests for session lifecycle
- Reach 50%+ coverage

### Long-term Goals (Next month)

- Achieve 85%+ coverage across all modules
- Add comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests
- Implement advanced testing patterns (stress testing, fuzzing, etc.)

## Key Areas Needing Attention

### Critical Components with No Coverage

1. **InterruptionManager** - 0.00% (353 lines)
1. **NaturalScheduler** - 0.00% (338 lines)
1. **TeamKnowledge** - 0.00% (284 lines)
1. **WorktreeManager** - 0.00% (121 lines)

### Low-Coverage Core Modules

1. **SessionManager** - 62.07% (161 lines, 140 missing)
1. **ReflectionDatabase** - 17.70% (201 lines, 159 missing)
1. **AdvancedSearch** - 16.88% (234 lines, 181 missing) [IMPROVING]
1. **MultiProjectCoordinator** - 21.43% (172 lines, 124 missing)
1. **TokenOptimizer** - 13.20% (264 lines, 217 missing)

With continued effort on these areas, we can significantly improve the test coverage and reliability of the session-mgmt-mcp project.
