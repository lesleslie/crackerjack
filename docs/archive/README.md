# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical implementation plans and phase completion reports that have been fully implemented. These documents are preserved for reference but are no longer part of the active documentation.

## Structure

- **`implementation-plans/`** - ACB migration design docs, workflow architecture, and integration plans
- **`phase-completions/`** - Completion reports for ACB workflow migration phases 2-7

## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during active development but are no longer needed for day-to-day work:

- ✅ All described features have been implemented
- ✅ Architecture decisions are now reflected in the codebase
- ✅ Phase migration work is complete (ACB is now the default)

## For Current Documentation

See `/docs/README.md` for active, current documentation.
