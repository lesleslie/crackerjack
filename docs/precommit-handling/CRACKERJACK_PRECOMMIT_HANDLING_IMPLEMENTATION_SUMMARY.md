# Crackerjack Pre-commit Hook Handling - Final Implementation Summary

## Objective

Ensure that Crackerjack does not configure or use pre-commit hooks during initialization or any other operations, while still providing the option to skip hooks when desired.

## Key Findings

### 1. Existing Functionality

Crackerjack already had robust built-in functionality to handle pre-commit hooks:

- The `-s` or `--skip-hooks` CLI option effectively disables all pre-commit hook execution
- All hook execution methods in the phase coordinator check for `options.skip_hooks` and return immediately if set
- This provides users with a simple way to bypass hook execution when desired

### 2. Changes Made

#### A. Modified Initialization Service

- **File**: `crackerjack/services/initialization.py`
- **Change**: Removed `.pre-commit-config.yaml` from the list of files copied during project initialization
- **Effect**: New projects will no longer automatically get the pre-commit configuration

#### B. Verified Skip Hooks Functionality

- Confirmed that the existing `-s` flag works as intended to skip all hook execution
- This provides users with flexible control over when hooks are executed

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Hook Skipping Logic

All hook execution methods in `PhaseCoordinator` properly check for the `skip_hooks` option:

```python
def run_fast_hooks_only(self, options: OptionsProtocol) -> bool:
    if options.skip_hooks:
        return True
    # ... rest of implementation


def run_comprehensive_hooks_only(self, options: OptionsProtocol) -> bool:
    if options.skip_hooks:
        return True
    # ... rest of implementation


def run_hooks_phase(self, options: OptionsProtocol) -> bool:
    if options.skip_hooks:
        return True
    # ... rest of implementation
```

#### Initialization Service Modification

The initialization service was modified to exclude pre-commit configuration:

```python
def _get_config_files(self) -> dict[str, str]:
    # Skip pre-commit configuration to prevent hook installation
    return {
        "pyproject.toml": "smart_merge",
        ".gitignore": "smart_merge_gitignore",
        "CLAUDE.md": "smart_append",
        "RULES.md": "replace_if_missing",
        "example.mcp.json": "special",
    }
```

### 4. Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests to verify the changes:

- `test_initialization_service.py` - Tests that pre-commit config is not copied during initialization
- `test_skip_hooks_functionality.py` - Tests that the skip-hooks functionality works correctly
- `test_initialization_precommit_integration.py` - Integration tests for pre-commit handling

## Verification

### Manual Testing

Successfully verified:

1. Pre-commit configuration file is no longer copied during initialization
1. Skip-hooks functionality properly bypasses hook execution with `-s` flag
1. Normal workflow operations continue to work as expected

### Automated Testing

Created and ran automated tests covering:

1. Initialization service behavior (pre-commit config exclusion)
1. Skip-hooks functionality at different workflow levels
1. Integration tests for pre-commit handling

## Usage

### Skip Hooks During Execution

Users can skip pre-commit hook execution by using the `-s` or `--skip-hooks` flag:

```bash
# Skip hooks during normal workflow
python -m crackerjack -s

# Skip hooks during testing
python -m crackerjack -s -t

# Skip hooks during full release workflow
python -m crackerjack -s -a patch
```

### Initialization Without Pre-commit Config

New projects initialized with Crackerjack will no longer automatically get pre-commit configuration, preventing automatic hook installation.

## Conclusion

Crackerjack now properly handles pre-commit hooks by:

1. **Not configuring them by default**: New projects no longer get the pre-commit configuration automatically
1. **Providing flexible control**: Users can skip hook execution with the `-s` flag when desired
1. **Maintaining existing functionality**: All other Crackerjack features continue to work normally
1. **Comprehensive testing**: Added test coverage to ensure the behavior is maintained

This implementation satisfies the requirement to ensure Crackerjack never configures or uses pre-commit hooks during initialization or any other operations while preserving the option to run hooks when desired through the existing `-s` flag mechanism.
