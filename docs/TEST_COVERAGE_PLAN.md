# Session Management MCP - Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status

We've made significant progress improving the test coverage for the session-mgmt-mcp project:

1. **Fixed existing test infrastructure issues**:

   - Fixed SessionPermissionsManager constructor issues
   - Fixed import and fixture errors
   - Fixed database initialization problems
   - Updated SessionPermissionsManager tests to match current implementation

1. **Implemented new unit tests**:

   - Created comprehensive tests for SessionLifecycleManager
   - Started work on AdvancedSearch tests
   - Added basic tests for ReflectionDatabase functionality

1. **Current test coverage**: ~12.5% (up from ~11.7%)

## Completed Work

### âœ… SessionPermissionsManager Tests

- Fixed constructor issues in tests
- Updated tests to match current implementation
- All tests now pass

### âœ… SessionLifecycleManager Tests

- Created comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Quality score calculation
  - Project context analysis
  - Session initialization
  - Checkpoint creation
  - Session ending
  - Status reporting

### âœ… ReflectionDatabase Basic Tests

- Created basic tests for method existence
- Fixed missing method calls in existing tests

## Ongoing Work

### ðŸ”„ AdvancedSearch Tests

- Currently in progress
- Need to fix database initialization issues
- Need to implement comprehensive search functionality tests

## Remaining Work

### Core Module Unit Tests (Highest Priority)

1. **MultiProjectCoordinator** (~21.43% coverage)

   - Test project group creation and management
   - Test dependency tracking and visualization
   - Test cross-project search functionality
   - Test session linking between projects

1. **TokenOptimizer** (~13.20% coverage)

   - Test token counting accuracy
   - Test different optimization strategies
   - Test caching mechanisms
   - Test performance with large content

1. **ReflectionDatabase** (~17.70% coverage)

   - Test database operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Test search functionality with various query types
   - Test embedding generation and similarity matching
   - Test error handling and edge cases

1. **AdvancedSearch** (~16.88% coverage)

   - Test text-based search with different filters
   - Test faceted search and aggregation
   - Test search suggestions and autocomplete
   - Test performance with large datasets

### Integration Tests

1. **Session Lifecycle Integration**

   - Test complete workflow from init to end
   - Test MCP tool registration and execution
   - Test cross-module interactions

1. **Multi-Project Integration**

   - Test project group workflows
   - Test dependency management across projects
   - Test cross-project search scenarios

### Specialized Tests

1. **Property-Based Tests**

   - Use Hypothesis to test robustness with random inputs
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions

1. **Performance Tests**

   - Test scalability and response times
   - Test memory usage with large datasets
   - Test concurrent access patterns

1. **Security Tests**

   - Test permission system and access controls
   - Test input validation and sanitization
   - Test protection against injection attacks

1. **Edge Case Tests**

   - Test error handling for malformed inputs
   - Test behavior with empty or null values
   - Test recovery from various failure modes

## Target Improvements

### Short-term Goals (Next 2-3 days)

- Fix remaining database initialization issues in AdvancedSearch tests
- Complete AdvancedSearch unit test implementation
- Implement ReflectionDatabase comprehensive tests
- Reach 25%+ coverage

### Medium-term Goals (Next 1-2 weeks)

- Implement MultiProjectCoordinator unit tests
- Implement TokenOptimizer unit tests
- Add integration tests for session lifecycle
- Reach 50%+ coverage

### Long-term Goals (Next month)

- Achieve 85%+ coverage across all modules
- Add comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests
- Implement advanced testing patterns (stress testing, fuzzing, etc.)

## Key Areas Needing Attention

### Critical Components with No Coverage

1. **InterruptionManager** - 0.00% (353 lines)
1. **NaturalScheduler** - 0.00% (338 lines)
1. **TeamKnowledge** - 0.00% (284 lines)
1. **WorktreeManager** - 0.00% (121 lines)

### Low-Coverage Core Modules

1. **SessionManager** - 62.07% (161 lines, 54 missing)
1. **ReflectionDatabase** - 17.70% (201 lines, 159 missing)
1. **AdvancedSearch** - 16.88% (234 lines, 181 missing)
1. **MultiProjectCoordinator** - 21.43% (172 lines, 124 missing)
1. **TokenOptimizer** - 13.20% (264 lines, 217 missing)

By systematically addressing these areas, we can significantly improve the test coverage and reliability of the session-mgmt-mcp project.
