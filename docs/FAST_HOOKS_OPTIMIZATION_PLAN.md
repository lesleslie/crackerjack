# Fast Hooks Optimization Plan

**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Status**: 🎯 DESIGN COMPLETE - Ready for Implementation  <!-- legacy status — see YAML frontmatter -->
**Expected Impact**: 10-50× speedup for typical commits

---

## Executive Summary

Fast hooks currently run on **all files** in the codebase, even when only a few files changed. By implementing **incremental file filtering** and **parallel optimization**, we can achieve **10-50× speedup** for typical commits while maintaining full code quality.

### Performance Impact Projection

| Scenario | Current Time | Optimized Time | Speedup |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| **Typical commit** (5-10 files) | 30-45s | 3-5s | **10-15×** |
| **Small change** (1-2 files) | 30-45s | 1-2s | **20-50×** |
| **Large change** (100+ files) | 30-45s | 30-45s | 1× (full scan) |
| **No changes** (re-run) | 30-45s | 0s | **∞** (skip) |

## Current Fast Hooks Analysis

### File-Modifying Hooks (Cannot run in parallel on same files)

| Hook | Timeout | Accepts File Paths | Can Use Incremental |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `ruff-format` | 240s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `ruff-check` | 240s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `mdformat` | 600s ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `codespell` | 150s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `trailing-whitespace` | 120s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | 120s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `format-json` | 120s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `validate-regex-patterns` | 120s | ❌ | ❌ |

### Read-Only Hooks (Already run in parallel)

| Hook | Timeout | Accepts File Paths | Can Use Incremental |
|------|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `check-yaml` | 60s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `check-toml` | 150s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `check-json` | 90s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `check-ast` | 90s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `check-local-links` | 60s | ✅ | ✅ |
| `uv-lock` | 60s | ❌ | N/A |
| `check-added-large-files` | 90s | ❌ | N/A |
| `pip-audit` | 180s | ❌ | N/A |

### Key Observations

1. **15 out of 16 hooks** (94%) support file paths → can use incremental filtering
2. **mdformat timeout is excessive** (600s = 10 minutes) → should be 180s
3. **Read-only hooks already run in parallel** via `FAST_STRATEGY.parallel=True`
4. **Only `validate-regex-patterns` cannot** use incremental filtering

---

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Incremental File Filtering (10-50× speedup)

**Implementation**: Use existing `SmartFileFilter.get_files_for_qa_scan()` infrastructure

**How it works**:
1. Detect changed files using `git diff`
2. Filter by file type (Python, Markdown, JSON, etc.)
3. Only pass changed files to hooks that support file paths
4. Hooks without file paths run as normal (full scan)

**Example**:
```bash
# Before: Format all 500 Python files
ruff format crackerjack/

# After: Format only 5 changed files
ruff format crackerjack/file1.py crackerjack/file2.py ...
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# settings/crackerjack.yaml
fast_hooks:
  incremental: true
  full_scan_threshold: 50  # Files changed
  base_branch: "main"
  force_incremental: false
  force_full: false
```

### Phase 2: Parallel by File Type (2-3× speedup)

**Implementation**: Group hooks by file type, run independent groups in parallel

**Hook Groups** (can run in parallel):
- **Python Group**: `ruff-format`, `ruff-check`, `check-ast`
- **Markdown Group**: `mdformat`, `check-local-links`
- **Config Group**: `check-yaml`, `check-toml`, `check-json`, `format-json`
- **General Group**: `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, `codespell`
- **Dependency Group**: `uv-lock`, `pip-audit`, `check-added-large-files`

**Why it's safe**:
- Different file types don't conflict
- Python hooks don't modify Markdown files
- Config hooks don't modify Python files

**Example**:
```python
# 5 groups running in parallel (each with 6 workers)
# Total: 30 concurrent operations (vs. 6 with current approach)
```

### Phase 3: Timeout Optimization (3× faster failure detection)

**Implementation**: Reduce excessive timeouts to reasonable values

| Hook | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `mdformat` | 600s | 180s | 3 minutes for Markdown formatting |
| `ruff-check` | 240s | 180s | Match comprehensive hooks timeout |
| `ruff-format` | 240s | 180s | Match comprehensive hooks timeout |

**Impact**: Faster failure detection, no impact on successful runs

---

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enable Incremental Fast Hooks

**File**: `crackerjack/config/hooks.py`

**Changes**:
1. Add `FastHooksSettings` class to `settings.py`
2. Update `FAST_STRATEGY` to use incremental file filtering
3. Modify hook execution to pass changed files

```python
# crackerjack/config/settings.py
class FastHooksSettings(Settings):
    """Settings for incremental fast hooks (only process changed files)."""
    incremental: bool = True
    full_scan_threshold: int = 50
    base_branch: str = "main"
    force_incremental: bool = False
    force_full: bool = False

# crackerjack/config/hooks.py
FAST_STRATEGY = HookStrategy(
    name="fast",
    hooks=FAST_HOOKS,
    timeout=300,
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy.NONE,
    parallel=True,
    max_workers=6,  # Already optimized in Phase 1
    incremental=True,  # NEW: Enable incremental filtering
)
```

### Step 2: Integrate SmartFileFilter

**File**: `crackerjack/executors/async_hook_executor.py`

**Changes**:
1. Inject `SmartFileFilter` into hook executor
2. Detect changed files before running hooks
3. Pass file list to hooks that support `accepts_file_paths=True`

```python
# In AsyncHookExecutor.execute_hook()
if hook.accepts_file_paths and self.file_filter:
    changed_files = self.file_filter.get_files_for_qa_scan(
        package_dir=Path.cwd(),
        force_incremental=self.settings.fast_hooks.incremental,
    )

    # Filter by file type
    hook_files = self._filter_files_by_type(changed_files, hook.name)

    # Update command with file paths
    cmd.extend([str(f) for f in hook_files])
```

### Step 3: Reduce mdformat Timeout

**File**: `crackerjack/config/hooks.py`

**Change**:
```python
HookDefinition(
    name="mdformat",
    timeout=180,  # Reduced from 600s
    ...
)
```

### Step 4: Add CLI Options

**File**: `crackerjack/cli/options.py`

**Add**:
```python
"fast_hooks_incremental": typer.Option(
    True,
    "--fast-hooks-incremental/--fast-hooks-full",
    help="Use incremental fast hooks (only changed files)"
),
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Default (Incremental)
```bash
python -m crackerjack run
# Only processes changed files
# Expected: 3-5s for typical commit
```

### Force Full Scan
```bash
python -m crackerjack run --fast-hooks-full
# Processes all files
# Expected: 30-45s
```

### Skip Fast Hooks (Iteration Mode)
```bash
python -m crackerjack run --skip-hooks -t
# Skip all hooks, run tests only
# Expected: 15-20s (tests only)
```

### Before Commit (Full Quality Check)
```bash
python -m crackerjack run --fast-hooks-full --comp
# Full scan + comprehensive hooks
# Expected: 4-6 min
```

---

## Testing & Verification

### Test 1: Incremental Mode
```bash
# Make small change
echo "# test" >> README.md

# Run incremental fast hooks
time python -m crackerjack run --fast-hooks-incremental

# Expected: 3-5 seconds
# Logs should show: "Using incremental fast hooks: 1 changed files"
```

### Test 2: Full Scan Mode
```bash
# Run full scan
time python -m crackerjack run --fast-hooks-full

# Expected: 30-45 seconds
# Logs should show: "Running full fast hooks scan (all files)"
```

### Test 3: No Changes
```bash
# No changes made
time python -m crackerjack run

# Expected: Skip fast hooks or <1 second
# Logs should show: "No changed files, skipping fast hooks"
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise with incremental fast hooks:

### Option 1: Disable Incremental
```yaml
# settings/crackerjack.yaml
fast_hooks:
  incremental: false
```

### Option 2: Force Full Scan via CLI
```bash
python -m crackerjack run --fast-hooks-full
```

### Option 3: Revert Code Changes
```python
# crackerjack/config/hooks.py
FAST_STRATEGY = HookStrategy(
    ...
    incremental=False,  # Revert
)
```
