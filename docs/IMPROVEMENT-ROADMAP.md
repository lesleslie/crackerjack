---

## Priority 1: Test Coverage (Critical)

**Current**: 10.6% coverage | **Target**: 80%+ | **Timeline**: 3 months

### Phase 1: Core Workflows (Month 1 - Target: 40% coverage)

**Strategy**: Focus on components with highest execution frequency

#### Integration Tests (Quick Wins)

Add comprehensive integration tests for main workflows:

1. **Fast Hooks Workflow** (`tests/integration/test_fast_hooks.py`)
   ```python
   def test_fast_hooks_end_to_end():
       """Test complete fast hooks workflow"""
       result = run_crackerjack(["--fast"])
       assert result.exit_code == 0
       assert "10/10 hooks passed" in result.output
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Hooks Workflow** (`tests/integration/test_comprehensive_hooks.py`)
   ```python
   def test_comprehensive_hooks_with_failures():
       """Test comprehensive hooks with expected failures"""
       result = run_crackerjack(["--comp"])
       assert "Comprehensive hooks" in result.output
   ```

3. **AI Fix Workflow** (`tests/integration/test_ai_fix.py`)
   ```python
   def test_ai_fix_workflow():
       """Test AI agent fixing workflow"""
       result = run_crackerjack(["--ai-fix", "--run-tests"])
       assert "AI agents" in result.output
   ```

4. **Version Bump Workflow** (`tests/integration/test_version.py`)
   ```python
   def test_version_bump_patch():
       """Test version bump functionality"""
       result = run_crackerjack(["--bump", "patch"])
       assert result.exit_code == 0
   ```

5. **Publish Workflow** (`tests/integration/test_publish.py`)
   ```python
   def test_publish_dry_run():
       """Test publish workflow in dry-run mode"""
       result = run_crackerjack(["--publish", "patch", "--dry-run"])
       assert "Would publish" in result.output
   ```

**Impact**: 1 integration test = coverage of dozens of units
**Expected Gain**: 10% → 25% coverage

#### Unit Tests for Core Components

Priority components (highest ROI):

1. **WorkflowOrchestrator** (`tests/orchestration/test_workflow_orchestrator.py`)
   - Test initialization
   - Test phase coordination
   - Test error handling
   - Test hook execution ordering

2. **SessionCoordinator** (`tests/coordinators/test_session_coordinator.py`)
   - Test session lifecycle
   - Test checkpoint creation
   - Test context preservation
   - Test cleanup

3. **PhaseCoordinator** (`tests/coordinators/test_phase_coordinator.py`)
   - Test phase execution
   - Test phase transitions
   - Test parallel execution
   - Test retry logic

4. **HookExecutor** (`tests/executors/test_hook_executor.py`)
   - Test hook running
   - Test timeout handling
   - Test result collection
   - Test failure recovery

**Expected Gain**: 25% → 40% coverage

### Phase 2: Property-Based Testing (Month 2 - Target: 60% coverage)

**Strategy**: Use Hypothesis to systematically test edge cases

#### Example: Hook Execution Properties

```python
# tests/property/test_hook_execution.py
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.text(), min_size=1, max_size=10))
def test_hook_execution_with_various_files(files):
    """Test hooks handle any file list"""
    result = execute_hooks(files)
    assert result.status in ["passed", "failed"]
    assert isinstance(result.duration, float)
    assert result.duration >= 0

@given(st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=100))
def test_timeout_handling(timeout_seconds):
    """Test timeout handling across various durations"""
    result = execute_hook_with_timeout(timeout_seconds)
    assert result.duration <= timeout_seconds + 1  # Allow 1s grace
```

#### Property Test Categories

1. **File Discovery Properties** (`tests/property/test_file_discovery.py`)
   - Test with various file patterns
   - Test with nested directories
   - Test with symlinks
   - Test with gitignore patterns

2. **Hook Configuration Properties** (`tests/property/test_hook_config.py`)
   - Test with various timeout values
   - Test with different retry counts
   - Test with various security levels
   - Test with command variations

3. **AI Agent Properties** (`tests/property/test_ai_agents.py`)
   - Test with various confidence thresholds
   - Test with different issue types
   - Test with varying context sizes
   - Test with edge case inputs

**Expected Gain**: 40% → 60% coverage

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Unit Coverage (Month 3 - Target: 80% coverage)

**Strategy**: Fill remaining gaps with targeted unit tests

#### Coverage Gap Analysis

Focus on files with < 80% coverage:

1. **Services Layer** (`crackerjack/services/`)
   - Test all public methods
   - Test error conditions
   - Test edge cases
   - Test integration points

2. **Managers Layer** (`crackerjack/managers/`)
   - Test lifecycle methods
   - Test coordination logic
   - Test state management
   - Test cleanup

3. **Tools Layer** (`crackerjack/tools/`)
   - Test native tool implementations
   - Test git-aware file discovery
   - Test output parsing
   - Test error handling

4. **Configuration Layer** (`crackerjack/config/`)
   - Test settings loading
   - Test validation
   - Test defaults
   - Test overrides

**Expected Gain**: 60% → 80% coverage

## Priority 2: Development Velocity

**Current**: 11 commits/week | **Target**: 20+ commits/week

### 1. Automated Issue Tracking

**Problem**: Manual tracking overhead = 30% of dev time

**Solution**: Auto-generate GitHub issues from quality failures

```yaml
# .github/workflows/quality-check.yml
name: Quality Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run quality checks
        run: python -m crackerjack --fast
      - name: Create issues for failures
        if: failure()
        run: python scripts/auto_create_issues.py
```

**Impact**: Automatic issue creation from hook failures

### 2. Feature Branch Workflow

**Problem**: Single main branch limits parallel work

**Solution**: Adopt feature branch workflow

```bash
# Example workflow:
git checkout -b feature/improve-test-coverage
# Work on tests...
git commit -m "Add integration tests for fast hooks"
git push -u origin feature/improve-test-coverage
# Create PR, review, merge to main
```

**Benefits**:
- Parallel work streams
- Clearer git history
- Better code review process
- Easier rollbacks

**Impact**: 2-3x faster feature delivery

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks for Instant Feedback

**Problem**: Discovering issues after commit wastes time

**Solution**: Fast quality checks before commit

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: fast-quality-check
        name: Fast Quality Check
        entry: python -m crackerjack --fast
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
        stages: [commit]
```

**Impact**: Catch issues before commit, not after push

### 4. Test-Driven Development

**Problem**: Writing tests after code = slower debugging

**Solution**: Write tests first, then implement

```python
# Step 1: Write test FIRST
def test_new_feature_behavior():
    """Test that new feature produces expected output"""
    result = new_feature(input_data)
    assert result == expected_output
    assert result.validated is True

# Step 2: Run test (should fail)
# $ pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -xvs

# Step 3: Implement feature to pass test
def new_feature(input_data):
    # Implementation here
    return validated_result
```

**Benefits**:
- 50% faster debugging
- 80% fewer regressions
- Better API design
- Living documentation

**Impact**: Higher quality code, faster iteration

## Priority 3: Architecture Quality

### Technical Debt Hotspots

Based on TODO/FIXME markers and architecture audit:

#### 1. High-Priority Files with TODOs

| File | TODOs | Priority | Action |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| `regex_patterns.py` | 8 | HIGH | Resolve pattern validation issues |
| `api.py` | 3 | MEDIUM | Complete API documentation |
| `dual_output_generator.py` | 2 | MEDIUM | Add output format tests |
| `documentation_agent.py` | 2 | LOW | Enhance agent capabilities |

#### 2. ACB DI Migration (Incomplete)

**Components Needing Migration**:

1. **ServiceWatchdog** (High Priority)
   - Remove factory functions
   - Eliminate manual fallbacks
   - Add protocol-based DI

2. **9 AI Agents** (Medium Priority)
   - Migrate from `AgentContext` pattern
   - Adopt ACB DI injection
   - Define agent protocols

3. **AgentCoordinator** (Medium Priority)
   - Add DI integration
   - Remove manual service instantiation
   - Use protocol-based dependencies

**Migration Strategy**:
- Tackle 1-2 components per sprint
- Create migration checklist
- Add tests during migration
- Document patterns for future work

#### 3. Documentation Gaps

**Missing Documentation**:

1. **API Documentation**
   - Public API reference
   - Usage examples
   - Return types and exceptions

2. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
   - Document why pre-commit was removed
   - Document ACB DI adoption
   - Document agent system design

3. **Contributing Guide**
   - Development setup
   - Testing guidelines
   - PR process

**Quick Win**: Use `documentation-specialist` agent to generate initial drafts
