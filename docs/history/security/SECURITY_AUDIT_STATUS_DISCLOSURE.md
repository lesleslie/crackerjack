# Security Audit Report: Status Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities

**Date**: January 3, 2025
**Auditor**: Security-Focused Claude Code
**Project**: Crackerjack - Python Project Management Tool
**Audit Scope**: Status output endpoints and information disclosure prevention
**Severity**: HIGH - Information disclosure vulnerabilities in production systems

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified **critical information disclosure vulnerabilities** in the Crackerjack status output system. The system was leaking sensitive system information including absolute paths, internal URLs, configuration details, and system state information through multiple endpoints. All identified vulnerabilities have been **remediated** with the implementation of a comprehensive secure status sanitization framework.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Absolute System Path Disclosure (HIGH Severity)

**CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)
**CWE**: CWE-200 - Information Exposure

#### Description

Status endpoints were exposing absolute system paths revealing:

- User directory structures (`/Users/username/Projects/...`)
- System temp directories (`/tmp/crackerjack-mcp-progress/...`)
- Internal project structure (`/absolute/path/to/project/...`)
- Progress file locations with full filesystem paths

#### Impact

- **Information Reconnaissance**: Attackers could map internal filesystem structure
- **Path Traversal Preparation**: Exposed paths could facilitate directory traversal attacks
- **User Privacy**: User directory names and project locations exposed
- **System Architecture Disclosure**: Internal directory structure revealed

#### Evidence

```json
// Before Fix - Sensitive path exposure
{
  "server_stats": {
    "project_path": "/Users/les/Projects/crackerjack",
    "progress_dir": "/tmp/crackerjack-mcp-progress",
    "resource_usage": {
      "temp_files_count": 5,
      "progress_dir": "/tmp/crackerjack-mcp-progress"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Fix Implemented ✅

- **Path Sanitization**: Absolute paths converted to relative paths where possible
- **Path Masking**: Paths outside project scope masked as `[REDACTED_PATH]`
- **Relative Path Conversion**: Project-relative paths shown as `./relative/path`
- **Basename Fallback**: When path can't be made relative, only basename shown

```json
// After Fix - Secure path handling
{
  "server_stats": {
    "project_path": "./cr***ack",
    "resource_usage": {
      "temp_files_count": 5
    }
  },
  "_security": {
    "sanitized": true,
    "verbosity": "standard"
  }
}
```

### 2. Internal URL and Port Disclosure (HIGH Severity)

**CVSS Score**: 6.5 (Medium-High)
**CWE**: CWE-200 - Information Exposure

#### Description

Status responses were exposing internal service URLs and ports:

- WebSocket server URLs with `localhost:8675`
- Internal API endpoints with `127.0.0.1` addresses
- Service discovery information for internal architecture

#### Impact

- **Service Enumeration**: Attackers could identify running services and ports
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Internal network topology partially revealed
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Exposed endpoints provide attack targets

#### Evidence

```json
// Before Fix - Internal URL exposure
{
  "services": {
    "websocket_server": {
      "port": 8675,
      "status": "http://localhost:8675/"
    }
  },
  "websocket_url": "ws://localhost:8675/ws/progress/{job_id}",
  "monitor_url": "http://localhost:8675/monitor/{job_id}"
}
```

#### Fix Implemented ✅

- **URL Sanitization**: Internal URLs replaced with `[INTERNAL_URL]` placeholder
- **Port Removal**: Specific port numbers removed from responses
- **Generic Endpoints**: Endpoint paths preserved but hosts sanitized

```json
// After Fix - Secure URL handling
{
  "services": {
    "websocket_server": {
      "status": "[INTERNAL_URL]"
    }
  },
  "websocket_url": "[INTERNAL_URL]/ws/progress/{job_id}",
  "monitor_url": "[INTERNAL_URL]/monitor/{job_id}"
}
```

### 3. Sensitive Configuration Exposure (MEDIUM Severity)

**CVSS Score**: 5.3 (Medium)
**CWE**: CWE-200 - Information Exposure

#### Description

Configuration details and system state information exposed through status endpoints:

- Rate limiter configuration with limits and windows
- Internal system statistics and resource usage
- Process information and system identifiers

#### Impact

- **Configuration Disclosure**: Internal limits and thresholds revealed
- **System Profiling**: Resource usage patterns exposed
- **Operational Security**: Internal system behavior revealed

#### Fix Implemented ✅

- **Verbosity-Based Filtering**: Different verbosity levels control information exposure
- **Configuration Masking**: Sensitive config values masked with asterisks
- **Key Removal**: Highly sensitive keys removed entirely at lower verbosity levels

### 4. Error Message Information Leakage (MEDIUM Severity)

**CVSS Score**: 4.3 (Medium)
**CWE**: CWE-209 - Information Exposure Through Error Messages

#### Description

Error responses included full stack traces and system paths in error messages:

- Python tracebacks with full file paths
- System error messages with internal details
- Exception details revealing code structure

#### Impact

- **Code Structure Disclosure**: Stack traces reveal internal code organization
- **Debug Information Leakage**: Development details exposed in production
- **Attack Vector Discovery**: Error details could reveal exploit opportunities

#### Fix Implemented ✅

- **Generic Error Messages**: Production-safe generic messages for low verbosity
- **Error Classification**: Errors categorized and appropriate generic messages used
- **Sanitized Error Details**: Higher verbosity levels show sanitized error information
- **Stack Trace Removal**: Full stack traces removed from production responses
