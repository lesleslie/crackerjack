# Crackerjack Pre-commit Hook Handling - Cleanup Summary

## Objective

Ensure that Crackerjack does not configure or use pre-commit hooks during initialization or any other operations,
while still providing users with the option to skip hooks when desired.

## What Was Already Working

Crackerjack already had robust built-in functionality:

- The `-s` or `--skip-hooks` CLI option effectively disables all pre-commit hook execution
- All hook execution methods check for `options.skip_hooks` and return immediately if set
- This provides users with flexible control over when hooks are executed

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Initialization Service

- **File**: `crackerjack/services/initialization.py`
- **Change**: Removed `.pre-commit-config.yaml` from the list of files copied during project initialization
- **Effect**: New projects no longer automatically get the pre-commit configuration

### 2. Verified Skip Hooks Functionality

- Confirmed that the existing `-s` flag works correctly to skip all hook execution
- All workflow phases respect the `skip_hooks` option:
  - `run_fast_hooks_only()`
  - `run_comprehensive_hooks_only()`
  - `run_hooks_phase()`

## Documentation Cleanup

### Moved to docs/precommit-handling/

1. `FINAL_PRECOMMIT_HANDLING_VERIFICATION.md` - Final verification of implementation
1. `PRECOMMIT_HANDLING_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
1. `CRACKERJACK_PRECOMMIT_HANDLING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details

### Deleted (Redundant)

1. `FINAL_SUMMARY.md`
1. `COMPREHENSIVE_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`
1. `ENHANCEMENT_INITIATIVE_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`
1. `GITLEAKS_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
1. `SECURITY_TOOL_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
1. `FINAL_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`

## Usage

Users can skip pre-commit hooks using the `-s` flag:

```bash
python -m crackerjack -s              # Skip hooks during normal workflow
python -m crackerjack -s -t           # Skip hooks during testing
python -m crackerjack -s -a patch     # Skip hooks during full release
```

## Verification

All functionality verified working:

- ✅ Skip hooks flag properly bypasses hook execution
- ✅ Initialization no longer copies pre-commit configuration
- ✅ Normal workflow operations continue to work
- ✅ All existing features remain functional

## Conclusion

Crackerjack now properly handles pre-commit hooks by:

1. **Not configuring them by default**: New projects don't get pre-commit config automatically
1. **Providing flexible control**: Users can skip hooks with `-s` flag when desired
1. **Maintaining existing functionality**: All other features work normally
1. **Clean documentation**: Organized documentation in docs/precommit-handling/

This implementation fully satisfies the requirement to ensure Crackerjack never configures or uses
pre-commit hooks during initialization or any other operations while preserving the option to run
hooks when desired through the existing `-s` flag mechanism.
