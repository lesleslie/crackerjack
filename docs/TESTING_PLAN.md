# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current State

The current test coverage for the session-mgmt-mcp project is quite low at approximately 11.66%. There are several key issues preventing tests from running properly:

1. **Database initialization issues**: Many tests fail due to DuckDB connection problems
1. **Constructor issues**: Tests are trying to instantiate classes without required parameters
1. **Missing methods**: Tests are calling methods that don't exist in the current implementation
1. **Outdated test expectations**: Tests were written for older versions of the code

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Fixed SessionPermissionsManager tests**: Updated tests to match the current implementation which requires a claude_dir parameter
1. **Created basic ReflectionDatabase tests**: Verified that core methods exist and can be called
1. **Fixed import and fixture issues**: Resolved several failing tests due to incorrect imports and fixtures

## Areas Needing Further Work

### Core Modules Needing Unit Tests

1. **SessionManager** - Core session management functionality
1. **ReflectionDatabase** - Database operations for storing/retrieving reflections
1. **AdvancedSearch** - Semantic search and faceted search functionality
1. **MultiProjectCoordinator** - Cross-project relationship management
1. **TokenOptimizer** - Token counting and optimization
1. **Config** - Configuration management

### Integration Tests Needed

1. **Session lifecycle** - Complete workflow from init to end
1. **MCP tool registration** - Verification that all tools are properly registered
1. **Cross-project functionality** - Multi-project coordination features
1. **Search functionality** - Full search stack testing

### Property-Based Tests

1. **Input validation** - Robust testing of edge cases and invalid inputs
1. **Concurrency** - Testing thread safety and concurrent access
1. **Performance** - Stress testing with large datasets

### Security Tests

1. **Permission system** - Testing trusted operation management
1. **Database security** - SQL injection prevention and access controls
1. **Input sanitization** - Handling of malicious input

## Target Coverage Goals

- Overall project coverage: 85%+
- Critical modules (ReflectionDatabase, SessionManager): 90%+
- Core functionality (MCP tools, search, permissions): 95%+

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Fix existing tests first** - Resolve all current test failures
1. **Add missing unit tests** - Implement tests for uncovered core modules
1. **Create integration tests** - Test complete workflows and feature interactions
1. **Add property-based tests** - Improve robustness with generative testing
1. **Implement security tests** - Ensure proper access controls and input validation
1. **Add performance tests** - Verify performance characteristics under load

## Priority Modules for Testing

1. **ReflectionDatabase** (currently at 17.70% coverage)
1. **SessionPermissionsManager** (needs updated tests)
1. **MCP Tools** (various tools with little to no coverage)
1. **Search functionality** (critical feature with low coverage)
1. **Configuration management** (foundational component)

By focusing on these areas systematically, we can significantly improve the overall test coverage and reliability of the session-mgmt-mcp project.
